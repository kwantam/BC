BC is a ballistic calculator for Maemo 5 (Nokia N900). It is written
in C and uses code from the GNU Ballistics Library, originally by
Derek Yates.

BUILDING

You will need the Maemo development environment up and running before you
can build this program. For more information on this, see
	http://maemo.org/development/

Once you have this up and running, cd into the bc directory and simply type
"make." For testing inside the dev environment on a PC, use the _X86 arch;
for building on the phone, use the _ARMEL arch.

BC requires a C compiler that supports nested functions (such as the gcc
from the Maemo environment).

INSTALLATION

To install, you need to copy three files to your phone:

bc -> /usr/local/bin
bc.desktop -> /usr/share/applications/hildon
bc.png -> /usr/share/icons

USAGE NOTES

A few notes on the meanings of the fields:

Sight height is the distance from the sight to the bore center in inches.

Sight angle is the angle of the bore relative to the plane perpendicular
to gravity. Positive angles are shooting uphill, negative angles are down.
Should be in the range -90 to 90.

POI at zero range is the distance from the point of aim to the point of
impact at the zero range. For example, if you have sighted your rifle
1" high at 100 yards, enter 1 here and 100 in the zero range field.
